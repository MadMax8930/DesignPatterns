### Adapter
We have a USB cable and a USB port we can plug in the USB cable which will directly fit into the port but instead
if we have a micro USB cable it's not compatible. So instead we need a micro to USB adapter which extends from the
USB clasp but its composed of a micro USB cable which will be plugged into the adapter. And then we can plug our
micro USB cable into the adapter and then plug it into the port. And it works just like a regular USB cable.

### Facade
Facade is an outward appearance that is used to conceal a less pleasant or credible reality.
In the programming world, the outward appearance is the class or interface we interact with as programmers.
And the less pleasant reality is hopefully the complexity that is hidden from us.
So a facade is simply a wrapper class that can be used to abstract lower level details that we don't want to worry about.
